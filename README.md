# Rust Mini_Blockchain

> Work in Progress: Just getting started, but having fun learning Rust and blockchain!

Hi there! This is my little Rust project where I’m experimenting with a simple Bitcoin-inspired blockchain. I’m building it for my learnning and practice purpose.

---

## What Works So Far 
- Genesis block is created successfully  
- You can add new blocks to the chain  
- SHA256 hashing keeps each block’s data safe  
- The chain can be validated (checks that blocks link correctly)  
- Code is organized in modules for easier reading and expansion  

---

## What’s Next 
- Adding peer-to-peer networking so blocks can “talk” to each other 
- Implementing a simple transaction pool 
- Experimenting with smart contract-style scripts 
- Building a simple CLI interface to play with the blockchain   
- More tests and possibly CI/CD automation  

---

## What I’m Learning 
- Rust basics: ownership, borrowing, modules, and error handling  
- Blockchain concepts: blocks, chain validation, and hashes  
- Cryptography: SHA256 hashing and block integrity  
- How to plan, document, and structure a growing project

## Running the Project 
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rust-mini-blockchain.git
